# Installation

```shell
pip install pysorteddict
```

pysorteddict requires Python 3.10 or newer. It has been tested using CPython and PyPy, and binary wheels for the same
are provided for most 64-bit Linux, macOS and Windows hosts.

[View the project on PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/pysorteddict/)

Wheels for Raspberry Pi family of computers may be found on piwheels, but they might lag behind those on PyPI.

<p class="notice">
If there are no wheels available for your platform, upon running the above command, pip will attempt to build
pysorteddict from source. This requires that the Python development headers and libraries be installed, and that a C++
compiler be available. (On Windows, this compiler must support C++20. On other operating systems, it need support only
C++14.)
