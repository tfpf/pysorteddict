# Installation

```shell
pip install pysorteddict
```

pysorteddict requires Python 3.10 or newer. It has been tested using CPython and PyPy, and binary wheels for the same
are provided for most 64-bit Linux, macOS and Windows hosts.

[View the project on PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/pysorteddict/)

Wheels for the Raspberry Pi family of computers may be found on piwheels, but they might lag behind those on PyPI.

The piwheels page is not controlled by me.

<p class="notice">
If there are no wheels available for your platform, running the above installation command may result in compilation
from source. For this to be successful, a C++ compiler must be available, and the Python development headers and
libraries must be installed. (On Windows, this compiler must support C++20. On other operating systems, it need support
only C++14.)
